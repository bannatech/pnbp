# pnbp

pnbp is a simple, scriptable and extendable platform to generate static websites
with simple configuration and dynamic content.

I can't possibly use someone elses software for static website generation, so I
made my own.

# Installing

## Dependencies:

* Python 3.x

* pyyaml (`pip install pyyaml`)

## How to install

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/bannana/pnbp.git
  
$ cd pnbp
# Install pnbp
$ sudo make install
```

# Basic usage

To set up a basic site, run `pbuild -i`

For information regarding configration documentation, please refer to the
[documentation](http://pnbp.nanner.co). (which is very sparse)
