Templates are the base of most websites. You have the fancy logo, navigation,
and footers looking generally the same for every webpage, and the body of the
webpage is where the mutable and dynamic content resides. This doesn't mean you
must follow this paradigm, but it is helpful to be able to re-create this in 
your website if you want to take advantage of what website generators are 
designed for.
