# `pnbp` - *p*nbp is *n*ot a *b*logging *p*latform

pnbp is a static web-page builder that's based off of the idea that if it's not
done, it can be scripted to do so.

Go take a look at the [getting started guide](/docs/post/getting_started), or
view it on [GitHub](https://github.com/bannatech/pnbp)
